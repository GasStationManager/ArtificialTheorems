# ArtificialTheorems: Autoformalization of Theoretical Foundations of AI/ML

This repo is a library of Lean formalizations of theoretical foundations of AI and ML. We explicitly allow and encourage AI-generated / AI-assisted proofs. 
- The theorem statements (in directory `ArtificialTheoremsSpec/`) are vetted by human experts.
- The proofs (in `ArtificialTheorems/`) are checked using secure verifiers (Comparator, SafeVerify) to ensure that they prove exactly the statements in `ArtificalTheoremsSpec/`
